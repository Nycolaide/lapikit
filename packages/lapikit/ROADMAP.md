Lapikit keeps moving forward. This page gives you a clear view of what’s coming next: new components, design updates, and small things that make your workflow smoother. The goal stays the same: keep Lapikit simple, fast, and built for you developers.

## Changes planned for 2026

2026 marks a new phase for Lapikit, with a clear focus:
Improve integration, strengthen fundamentals, and enrich the ecosystem without complicating the API.

**New core: Lili v1**

Lapikit will introduce **Lili v1**, a new preprocessor Svelte.

Objectives:

- Facilitate the integration of components into existing projects
- Offer greater flexibility in terms of styles and composition
- Open the door to new possibilities in terms of tooling.

More details will be shared as it develops.

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 1em; display: block;">New components</p>

Strengthening form components, essential for real-world applications :

- **Radio** manages exclusive choices in forms with accessible radio buttons.
- **Select** is a simple and customizable selection component for drop-down lists.
- **Checkbox** allows you to enable or disable options via clear and consistent checkboxes.
- **Input files** selects and manages files with complete style control.
- **Input textarea** is a multi-line input field for long content and advanced forms.

Simple, accessible components that are consistent with the rest of Lapikit.

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 1em; display: block;">Helpers</p>

Added lightweight helpers to avoid repetition in projects:

- Format number offers the possibility to round and shorten numbers
- Capitalize allows you to capitalize the first letter of a word or sentence

The goal is not to replace a utility library, but to cover common cases.

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 1em; display: block;">Internal Helpers</p>

Improvement of internal tools for greater consistency and maintainability:

- ClassName helper will be as close as possible to Svelte class management
- Centralized style management that will offer the same possibilities as Svelte's style props

**Continuous development**

Other features may be added during the year.
