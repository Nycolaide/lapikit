Lapikit is a Svelte component library focused on the development experience, ease of integration and complete customization of each component. Use it to create accessible, high-performance user interfaces without sacrificing customization and performance.

## Made by FrontEnd for FrontEnd

Lapikit is designed to let you optimize your code and concentrate on the complex features of your project.
Every component has been thought through in this way:

- Designed in Svelte and Typescript
- Stable, simple and varied APIs
- [Breakpoint](/docs/breakpoints) support depending on screen size
- Default settings that ensure immediate operation
- Clear [documentation](/docs/getting-started) with examples

## Why create the Lapikit library

A simple, no-frills library

Lapikit's aim is to offer a complete component library that works independently, with no significant dependency on other libraries or packages. (apart from Svelte, of course). The principle is to retain control over the evolution of the library without depending on the rules of other packages. We control the styles, components and plugins, which ensures greater security and long-term support.

Each component comes with a default style and the option of modifying it completely. A theme manager and utility functions complete Lapikit to ensure rapid integration of your system design into all components.

You contribute your styles using standard class accessories starting with kit or data-\* attributes (pre-alpha actually).

### The roots of Lapikit

Lapikit is a fusion of the words rabbit (in French) , Lapis lazuli, a precious blue stone, and the word kit, which refers to the development kit.

### Community

Lapikit is developed and maintained by Nycolaide and is inspired by Material Design v3. Documentation is provided by Nycolaide and Simone De Sousa Fernandes. Contributions, issues and feedbacks are welcome and important for the evolution of the project.
