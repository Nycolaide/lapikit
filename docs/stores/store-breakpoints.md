Lapikit exposes a Svelte store called breakpoints.
It always contains a merged version of the default values and your overrides defined in `plugins/lapikit.(js|ts)`.

This allows you to centralize your responsive design thresholds without having to manage the merge logic manually.

<Sandbox name="use-stored-breakpoints" code={BreakpointStoredBase}/>

You can customize all breakpoints directly via the `plugins/lapikit.(js|ts)` configuration file. Feel free to consult the documentation [breakpoints](/docs/breakpoints) provided, which will allow you to see all the options available for adapting Lapikit to your application.
